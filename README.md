spring2013hackathon
===================

Morgan Stanley Sponsored Hackathon with the Marist College Computer Society.  Morgan Stanley's Global Trading Placement Engine Challenge.  The program were written in a matter of 45 hours, on 2 hours of sleep, so there are definitely more efficient or better ways to code some of the processes in general. Also note, I went into this never having coded in C#.  I reccommend using Microsoft Visual Studio, as some compilers and IDEs have issues with some of the commands, at least in the c++ file. Either way, you have been warned.

-C++ attempt basically shows how to connect to a network socket as a client, though the example cannot be directly run without the server being active and the correct port being open. There was also the issue of the code not working well in the IDE I was using, Netbeans, as it has issues with some commands.

-C# is a working run of the program which connect to the server, parses out the data and applies an algorithm to the proper data.  The algorithim is not the smartest and definitely not the best, it is mostly on the safe side, to get better output overall with few errors. It has be run in a 24 hour and 72 hour standard environment, though I assume that under strenuous real world testing it would fail, probably horrendously.
